      description:
        - title: Probing the Electric Double Layer Capacitance
          contents:
            - Analyzed adsorption behavior of acetone and methylamine on copper electrodes using impedance spectroscopy
            - Investigated interfacial polarizability and EDL capacitance via grand canonical DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics
        - title: Cu-based Electrode Degradation and Stability
          contents:
            - Uncovered Cu dissolution mechanisms in amine solutions using Grand Canonical DFT, revealing surface restructuring even at negative potentials
            - Identified amine-driven Cu extraction and complexation as key factors in cathode degradation under electroreduction conditions
        - title: Electrochemical Reductive Amination Reactivity
          contents:
            - Investigated Pb's role in electrochemical hydrogenation, revealing a dynamic PbH₂–PbH₄ cycle that facilitates imine reduction
            - Demonstrated Pb acts as a hydrogen shuttle, lowering energy barriers and enhancing catalytic efficiency in reductive amination
            - Extended this hydrogen shuttle effects to other post-transition metals, such as Tl, Pb and Bi
