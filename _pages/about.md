Hey, thank you for visiting my Homepage!

I'm a PhD candidate in computational chemistry at UCLA working under the guidance of [Prof. Philippe Sautet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SMrNoFUAAAAJ&hl=en). Before it, I worked as undergraduate researcher at Hebei University of Technology under the guidance of [Prof. Jingde Li](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=86gvU-wAAAAJ&hl=en) focusing on computational hetergeneous catalysis. 

My research interests include rational understanding and design of electrochemical systems, catalysts and other materials. 

Beyong my research, I am into hiking, reading, road trips and photography.
