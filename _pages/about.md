Hey there â€” thanks for visiting my homepage!

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Chemistry at UCLA, advised by [Prof. Philippe Sautet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SMrNoFUAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this, I was an undergraduate researcher at Hebei University of Technology, working with [Prof. Jingde Li](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=86gvU-wAAAAJ&hl=en) on projects in computational heterogeneous catalysis.

My research centers on the rational understanding and design of electrochemical systems, catalytic processes, and functional materials through first-principles simulations and data-driven approaches.

Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking, road trips, photography, and getting lost in a good book.
